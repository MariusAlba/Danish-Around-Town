### Purpose 
This is an educational website with the purpose to help introduce users to the Danish language and help them get more familiar with it. This app will be targeted to the expats who come here for studies, are married to Danes, have their own business in Denmark, employed in a Danish company or who have in any other way decided to settle down in Denmark. This app would help them search for the meanings of the words that they get encountered with in their daily lives.
