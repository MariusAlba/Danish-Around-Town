# Danish-Around-Town

## Group 11 Students: Ioan Marius Alba, Aiza Omar, Ting-Yu Kuo, Yanjun Yin
### University project using ReactJS, Firebase, Bootstrap

### Purpose 
This is an educational website with the purpose to help introduce users to the Danish language and help them get more familiar with it. This app will be targeted to the expats who come here for studies, are married to Danes, have their own business in Denmark, employed in a Danish company or who have in any other way decided to settle down in Denmark. This app would help them search for the meanings of the words that they get encountered with in their daily lives.

Our Data Model is being explained and attached below:

We have created four entity tables such as User, Images, Question and Answer.
In the user table all the required information of the user is captured along with the foreign keys of images and question table. In the images table, the images uploaded by the users would be stored as a blob field type and their ids will be stored along with the English translation text(flipcards functionality). Question and answer tables would be more related to the quiz section of our app that would store all the Danish words and their respective answers selected by the users.
